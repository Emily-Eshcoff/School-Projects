  <h2>Our Programs</h2>





      <h3>Adults</h3>
        <p> One of the biggest reasons we began Night Light, and where we get our name, is the reality that faces many adults in todays age. Adults can go to work, have 
          families, and go completely unnoticed by the world around them that their reading skills and comprehension arent and never were up to a truly adequet level. 
        These are smart, highly intelligent people that society has left behind. For one reason or another, people can go their whole lives, living in the dark, hiding 
      this fact of themselves away out of shame. We aim to be the light, during that dark night, that guides them through their fears, to tackle this obstacle head on.
      No person deserves the indignity of not having the full capacity of their faculties to gauge the fast moving world around them. And so these mentors are just a few of 
    you may meet along this incredible journey of self-discovery. We couldnt be more proud to have such a wonderful team with us. </p>

      <h3>Children</h3>
        <p>Every adult we serve has countless stories of the troubles they faced as children. This is where everything starts. By doing everything we can to ensure the children of today grow up
          to have every tool at their disposal for the world they face tomorrow, we prevent a lifetime of hardship. It takes special hearts, to take the hands of these children and thats why we've
          built an experienced team of people who dont just have compassion for our children, they have the lived experience to know what it's like to grow up doing ten times more work just 
          to get through the day to day. Doing everything everyone else is doing while also hiding a part of yourself because of the stigma that comes from not having fully developed literacy.
