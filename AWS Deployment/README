For my AWS Deployment, Ive created documentation in the form of a powerpoint.

This powerpoint goes over each service utilized and the configuration of each asset for hosting of a website and managing the security, networking, and monitoring systems in place for 
two Virtual Machines hosted on individual VPCs and subnets.

The powerpoint goes into depth about each portion of the project. Along with understanding AWS deployment for VMs, VPCs, subnets, and such, there is also an EC2 instance for hosting a website.

The class itself introduced all related concepts through an RDP session aligned with a Microsoft Azure subscription so I practiced all skills displayed in the AWS deployment there first before doing them on my own on AWS
