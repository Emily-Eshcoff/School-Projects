This is the pseudocode that lays out the basic structure for a payroll program. Testing proofs are shown in a separate file. 

The structure is built on an iterative system, mainly consisting of for and while loops. Incorporating array structures, for integration with database and file systems. 
Would be best implemented in actual code (from the ones I've personally worked with) using a python program that integrates scripts to run SQL queries.
