 Test Case 1: Alice Lee (ID: A001)
Input:

Hours Worked: 35

Hourly Rate: $20.00

Overtime Rate: $30.00

Execution Steps:

Check if 35 > 40 → False

Base Hours = 35

Overtime Hours = 0

Base Pay = 35 × 20.00 = $700.00

Overtime Pay = 0 × 30.00 = $0.00

Gross Pay = 700.00 + 0.00 = $700.00

State Tax = 700.00 × 0.056 = $39.20

Federal Tax = 700.00 × 0.079 = $55.30

Total Tax = 39.20 + 55.30 = $94.50

Net Pay = 700.00 − 94.50 = $605.50

Base Pay = 40 × 25.00 = $1,000.00

Overtime Pay = 0 × 37.50 = $0.00

Gross Pay = 1000.00 + 0.00 = $1,000.00

State Tax = 1000.00 × 0.056 = $56.00

Federal Tax = 1000.00 × 0.079 = $79.00

Total Tax = 56.00 + 79.00 = $135.00

Overtime Rate: $37.50

Execution Steps:

Check if 0 > 40 → False

State Tax = $0.00

Federal Tax = $0.00

Net Pay = $0.00

No paycheck created → triggers error in finish()

Test Case 7: Emily White (ID: "")
Input:

Missing Employee ID

Hours Worked: 38

Execution Steps:

Read employee_id → ""

Attempt to read employee_file[] from file → likely fails

length(employee_file[]) < 6 → True

Trigger: "Error: Incomplete employee record."

check_end = "y" → payroll process stops

No calculations performed

 Test Case 8: George Black (ID: G011)
Input:

employee_file[] = [G011, George, Black, 2, 20.00] (only 5 fields)

Execution Steps:

length(employee_file[]) = 5 → Invalid

Trigger: "Error: Incomplete employee record."

check_end = "y"

Process ends without calculating pay

 Test Case 9: Ivan Grey (ID: I013)
Input:

Hours Worked: -5

Execution Steps:

-5 > 40 → False

Base Hours = -5 (invalid)

Base Pay = -5 × 20.00 = -100.00

Gross Pay = -100.00

Taxes = Negative amounts

Unexpected behavior unless validation is added

Should trigger: "Error: Invalid hours entered."
